# Sample Document: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a technique that combines information retrieval with text generation to produce more accurate and grounded responses from language models.

## How RAG Works

1. **Document Indexing**: Documents are processed and stored in a vector database with embeddings
2. **Query Processing**: User queries are converted into embeddings
3. **Retrieval**: Relevant documents are retrieved based on similarity
4. **Generation**: The language model generates responses using the retrieved context

## Benefits

- **Factual Accuracy**: Responses are grounded in retrieved documents
- **Up-to-date Information**: Can access current documents without retraining
- **Reduced Hallucination**: Less likely to generate false information
- **Transparency**: Retrieved sources can be cited

## Components

### Vector Databases
Vector databases store document embeddings for efficient similarity search. Popular options include:
- ChromaDB
- Pinecone
- Weaviate
- FAISS

### Embedding Models
Embedding models convert text into dense vector representations:
- Sentence-BERT
- OpenAI Embeddings
- Cohere Embeddings

### Language Models
The generation component uses large language models:
- GPT-4
- Claude
- Llama 2
- Qwen

## Best Practices

1. Chunk documents appropriately (200-500 tokens)
2. Use metadata for filtering
3. Implement hybrid search (keyword + semantic)
4. Cache frequent queries
5. Monitor and evaluate retrieval quality

## Challenges

- Balancing retrieval quantity vs quality
- Managing outdated information
- Computational costs
- Context window limitations
